<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Batch Job Scheduler is a feature that helps users create and update configurable jobs that perform various channel functions for selected channels. For example, listing products on marketplaces as well as updating inventory on marketplaces are a part of these batch jobs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Batch Jobs can be created and scheduled automatically while creating a channel. Users can add, edit, or monitor batch jobs from the Batch Job Scheduler screen.</p>
