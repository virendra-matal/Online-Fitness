<h1>Communication-Template-Wiki-ETP-Unify</h1>
<h3>Communication Template Use cases and Capabilities:</h3>
<p>Order Confirmation: When a customer places an order online or in-store, an automated order confirmation email or message can be sent using a template. This reassures the customer that their order has been received and is being processed.</p>
<p>Shipping and Delivery Updates: Templates can be used to send automated shipping and delivery notifications to customers, including tracking information. This keeps customers informed about the status of their orders and enhances the overall shopping experience.</p>
<p>Receipts and Invoices: Retail software can generate receipts and invoices automatically using templates. This helps in maintaining a professional and consistent look for financial documents while saving time on manual data entry.</p>
<p>Promotional Campaigns: Retailers often run marketing campaigns to promote products, sales, or events. Communication templates can be used for creating email newsletters, social media posts, or text messages to reach out to customers with these promotions.</p>
