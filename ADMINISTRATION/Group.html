<h1>ETP-UNIFY-WIKI-GROUP</h1>
<h5>Use Cases for Group:</h5>
<p>Here group means a corporate group or group of companies which are having parent &amp; subsidiary corporations that operate under the group.</p>
<p>It will be used to identify the top most level of management in the business entity.</p>
<p>The group company, also known as the holding company, holds a substantial portion of the shares or ownership stakes in its subsidiary companies. This ownership allows the group company to have significant control over the operations, management, and strategic decisions of the subsidiaries.</p>
<p>In financial reporting, group companies typically consolidate their financial statements. This means that the financial results of all subsidiary companies are combined into a single set of consolidated financial statements for the group. This provides a comprehensive view of the group's overall financial performance.</p>
<p>Group structures can provide certain tax and legal advantages, such as tax planning opportunities, asset protection, and centralized management.</p>
<p>Group companies may benefit from synergies between their subsidiaries. For example, shared resources, expertise, and technologies can be leveraged across the group to improve efficiency and competitiveness.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the specific structure and operations of group companies can vary widely depending on the legal and regulatory framework of the country in which they operate. Additionally, the terminology used to describe such entities may differ in different regions and legal systems.</p>
