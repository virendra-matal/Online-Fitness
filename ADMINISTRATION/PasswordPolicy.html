<h1>Password-Policy-Wiki-ETP-Unify</h1>
<h3>Password Policy:</h3>
<p>This master allows defining the password policy which will further be assigned to a user group.<br>Once you have assigned the password policy to a user group the same will be applicable on user login for all users available in the user group. If password policy is not configured then standard password policies will be applicable.<br>Passwords will be of minimum length of 8 characters &amp; Maximum up to 255 characters. It should contain the combination of alphabets [1 upper case (A-Z) and 1 lower case (a-z), numeric (0 - 9) and special characters (@, #, $, _, -, !, &amp;)].<br>Passwords can not contain space, tab &amp; special characters such as (/, , ~, &gt; etc).<br>Users won't be able to login if the password is expired or the user is Inactive only the Admin user will be able to activate the user.<br>Password reset will be done on the very first login in application.</p>
<p>For example, Let’s say a password policy is configured with below configurations:<br>Password Expiry in No. of Days? - 60<br>User Type - Store<br>Password Expiry Prompt in No. of Days? - 10<br>Passwords cannot be the same as last counts? - 3<br>No. of incorrect password attempts to block users? - 3<br>User Id auto unblock? - Yes<br>User Id auto unblock (Mins)? - 15 mins<br>Now whenever the store user logs in the application all above configurations will be checked and considered on log. I.e. system will not allow the user to login if the password is expired (password expiry = 60 days). If the user has logged in and password is about to expire then prior to password expiry last day the system will show a prompt to change password on UI. Also when the user tries to change the password validation for (point no. 4). If a user tries to login with incorrect password attempts then validation for (point no. 5 &amp; 6) will be done.</p>
