# Promotion Access

Promotion Access enables users to access promotions created by other user groups or individual users within a specific user group. By utilizing this functionality, users can view promotions in the Promotion list that are created by specific users or user groups.

To enable this functionality, the user needs to set the "Allow Promotion Access Control" property to "YES." This property serves as a control mechanism to determine whether a user should have access to promotions created by others.

When the "Allow Promotion Access Control" property is set to "YES" for a user, they will be granted permission to access and view promotions created by other user groups or users within the designated user group. This capability allows for effective promotion mapping and enhances collaboration among users by enabling the sharing of promotions across different groups.

In the Promotion Access list screen, you will find the following five headers:

Type: This header provides details about the user type associated with the promotion access. It indicates whether the promotion access is assigned to an individual user or a user group. For example, it may display "User" or "User Group" based on the type of access.

User/User Group: This header displays the name of the specific user or user group for which the promotion access is configured. It shows the username or the name of the user group. For instance, it could display "Username132" or the name of the user group, such as "Puma Group."

Allowed User Group Access: This header indicates the number of access groups allowed for the promotion access. It represents the maximum number of user groups that can access the promotion. For example, it may show a number like "4" to signify that up to four user groups are allowed to access the promotion.

Remark: This header displays any remarks or comments that have been entered for the specific promotion access. It provides additional information or context related to the access. For example, it may show a remark like "This access is for the Puma Group" to describe the purpose or scope of the promotion access.

Status: This header shows the status of the promotion access. It utilizes a visual indicator, such as a green dot for active or a grey dot for inactive, to represent the current status of the access. The green dot signifies that the promotion access is active and available, while the grey dot indicates that the access is inactive or disabled.

These headers provide a clear overview of the promotion access details, including the type of user, the associated user/user group name, the allowed user group access count, any remarks provided, and the status of the access.

In the List Screen, there will be a search box and a filter to assist users in finding specific users or user groups. To search for a specific user or user group, the user will need to follow these steps:

Locate the search box: Look for the search box on the List Screen. It may be placed at the top of the screen or in a designated area for search functionality.

Select the Type from the dropdown: Next to the search box, there will be a dropdown menu to select the type of search. By default, the "User" option will be preselected.

Enter the search query: Enter the name or keyword related to the user or user group you want to search for in the search box. For example, if you are searching for a user named "John," type "John" in the search box.

Under the three-dot menu, there will be an "Edit" option available. This option allows users to modify or make changes to the selected promotion access. Clicking on the "Edit" option will open a dialog or page where users can update the details, such as the user/user group, allowed user group access, remarks, or status, associated with the promotion access.
