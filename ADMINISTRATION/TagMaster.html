<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tag Master is a function which helps the user assign ‘Tags’ to products, orders and promotions within Ordazzle. This can be very helpful in the segmentation of products, promotions and transactions.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two types of tags within the Tag Master:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Common Tags: These tags are created from the Tag Master screen. The tags created on this screen can be used to tag products, orders and promotions. Common tags can only be created in the Tag Master screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My Tags: These tags are created from the ‘My Tag’ field across various screens like product and order screens. These tags cannot be created in the Tag Master screen. They can, however, be edited from the Tag Master screen.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Add/Create New Tag:</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">By clicking Add New Tags of the Tag Master screen, the user will be able to create new common tags. In this screen, the user will have to input three pieces of information: Function, Tags, and Status.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Functions: The user can select which function they will be creating tags for. These functions will be available in the dropdown for the selection&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tags: The user is able to create multiple tags for a single function using this field. After entering the tag, the user can use the spacebar to move on to the next tag for the function. If a tag was incorrectly created and needs to be removed, the user can click the ‘x’ icon next to the tag.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Active / Inactive: The user can choose to toggle between active and inactive based on what they want the status of their tag to be. Inactive tags will not be displayed in the UI in their respective functions.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Searching, Editing and Replacing Tags</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The user can search for existing tags using the search bar in the top section of the screen. They can search by either function, or by tags. Additionally, they are able to filter tags out by their statuses as well as their type of tag (common tag or my tag)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After finding the Tag the user wants to edit or replace, they can simply click on the ‘edit’ or ‘replace’ icons.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Edit - After clicking the edit option, the user can change the tag details as they see fit. They can also choose to toggle the active and inactive statuses of the tags.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Replace - After clicking the replace option, the screen will show the user the existing tag name, along with the number of records where this tag has been used. The user then has the option to enter a new tag they would like to replace the existing tag with. After selecting a new tag, the user simply has to click ‘replace’ and all existing records of the tag will be updated with the new tag.</p>
