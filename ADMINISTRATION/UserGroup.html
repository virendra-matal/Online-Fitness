<h1>User Group-WIKI-ETP-Unify</h1>
<h2>Use Cases and Capabilities of User Group:</h2>
<p>User groups in retail software play a crucial role in managing and personalizing the working experience of staff members and employees.</p>
<p>We can create user groups for different employee roles, such as cashiers, store managers, and inventory specialists. Assign specific access permissions and functionality based on these roles.</p>
<p>The User access can be allocated in groups instead of allocation of the access to single users individually, which is time consuming.</p>
<p>The User group Management module in ETP unify provides the service to add groups and allocate set of User Management rights so that its easier to allocate the same.<br>This module can be used as a template to create user in user management module, when the user group is selected in the User Management module, the modules and access already assigned in the User group will be pre-selected.</p>
