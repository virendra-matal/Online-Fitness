<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This enables the automation of the logistics function by providing integrations with selected carriers.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are 2 types of logistics setups:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The user can get to the Carrier Integration screen by going to ‘Connections’ in the menu, and selecting ‘Carrier Integration’.</p>
