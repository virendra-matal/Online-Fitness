<p><strong>Location Transfer -&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Location Transfer is one of the categories of the Stock transaction in ETP Unify.</p>
<p>This Stock transaction is used only when the stocks need to be transferred within the same Node ( Store ) from one location to another location.

<p>The ETP Unify User can create a Location Transfer by going to the Inventory Management Menu and clicking on Stock Transaction. The user then has to go to the Plus icon and click on Location Transfer.</p>
