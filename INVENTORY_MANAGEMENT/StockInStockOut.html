<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Stock In-&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Stock In is a category within the Stock transactions feature in ETP Unify, an integrated software solution. It enables users to manually add or remove stock from the system at their convenience. This functionality can be adjusted at the node level, allowing for specific stock changes. Notably, any modifications made through the Stock In/Stock Out feature will automatically update the stock quantities listed on various marketplaces and e-commerce websites through API integration. Moreover, inventory management can also be performed through an upload function, facilitating bulk updates. External systems, such as other ERP or POS systems, can utilize the Stock In or Stock Out service to ensure consistent and accurate stock updates in ETP Unify based on relevant transactions in those systems.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ETP Unify User can create a Stock In by going to the Inventory Management Menu and clicking on Stock Transaction. The user then has to go to the Plus icon and click on Stock In.</p>
