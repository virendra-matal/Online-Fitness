<p><strong>Transfer Order</strong></p>
<p>A transfer order is a type of Stock transaction in which the inventory is getting transferred from one node (Store) to another Node ( Store )&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transferring stock from one retail store to another retail store is a common practice in the retail industry to optimize inventory management and meet customer demand. Here's a general overview of how the stock transfer process typically works:</p>
<p>Assess inventory needs: Determine the inventory requirements of the receiving store. This can be done by analyzing sales data, customer demand, and stock levels at both stores.</p>
<p>Initiate the transfer: Create a stock transfer request, specifying the items, quantities, and any special handling instructions. This request is usually made through a centralized inventory management system or other internal communication channels.</p>
<p>Prepare the stock: Once the transfer request is approved, the stock is prepared for transfer. This involves packaging the items securely, ensuring proper labeling, and organizing them for shipment.</p>
<p>Arrange transportation: Coordinate the logistics of moving the stock from the sending store to the receiving store. This may involve using a third-party logistics provider, in-house transportation, or other available options.</p>
<p>Document the transfer: Prepare the necessary documentation, such as transfer orders or waybills, to record the movement of stock between stores. These documents serve as a record of the transfer and help with inventory reconciliation.</p>
<p>Monitor and track: Keep track of the stock during transit to ensure its safe and timely arrival at the receiving store. This can be done using tracking numbers, real-time visibility systems, or other means of monitoring the shipment.</p>
<p>Receive and reconcile: Once the stock arrives at the receiving store, it should be promptly inspected, counted, and reconciled with the transfer documentation. Any discrepancies or damages should be documented and addressed accordingly.</p>
<p>Update inventory systems: Reflect the transferred stock in the inventory management system of both stores to ensure accurate stock levels and availability for future sales.</p>
<p>To Create a new Transfer Order the ETP Unify user needs to go to the Inventory management and then click on Stock transaction. After that, the user needs to click on the Plus sign and then click on Transfer order to create a new one.</p>

<p>The ETP Unify user needs to select For Node from the selection ( The selection will show the Nodes ( Store ) assigned to him as a user in the user management function ) Then the user needs to select To Node ( the selection will come from the relation created by the user in the Node to Node relation function ) If there is no relation created then the user can create Transfer order to any Node he desired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The user then has to select Stock Order Type from the options which are coming from Stock Order Types created under transfer order in the Stock Order type function. The reason should be selected by the user from the options which are coming from the reason master under the transfer order</p>

<p>Once the user has completed entering the details in the CSV file, then the user can upload the file. If there are errors in the upload these errors will be shown with reasons on the screen.

<p>Now the user can Save the Transfer order by clicking on the save button and then he will be redirected to the Stock transaction list screen where he will be able to view the Transfer Order that he has created.</p>
