<h1><strong>UOM Conversion Wiki - ETP Unify</strong></h1>
<h3>Use-case of UOM-conversion:</h3>
<p>In ETP Unify “ UOM Conversion” are essential in various industries and applications to ensure accurate and consistent measurement and communication of quantities.<br>In retail, manufacturing, and logistics, products often come in various packaging sizes and units. UOM conversions help maintain accurate inventory counts and track stock levels in different units, making it easier to manage and reorder products.</p>
<h3>Capabilities of UOM-conversion In ETP Unify:</h3>
<p>Conversion Factors: UOM conversion typically involves the use of conversion factors. These factors define the relationship between different units of measure for the same quantity. For example, 1 meter is equal to 3.28084 feet, so the conversion factor from meters to feet is 3.28084.</p>
<p>Complex Conversions: Some conversions can be more complex and involve multiple steps or intermediate conversions. For example, converting from pounds per square inch (psi) to pascals (Pa) may require converting both the pressure units and the area units.</p>
<p>Currency Conversion: In financial and e-commerce applications, UOM conversion may also include currency conversion to calculate exchange rates and perform financial transactions.</p>
<p>Conversion Tables and Factors: They may provide access to extensive tables or databases of conversion factors for a wide range of units and categories.</p>
<p>Integration: UOM conversion functionality can be integrated into larger software systems, such as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software, to ensure consistency in measurements across different modules.</p>
<h4>Functionality of UOM-Conversion In ETP Unify:</h4>
<p>The user can navigate through ETP Unify- Product Management- Uom Conversion.</p>
<p>Once a user goes through the Uom conversion the set of UOMS which has been configured will get displayed.</p>
<p>The Search Bar Tab In the UOm conversions Screen will allow the user to search the Mapped UOM with the UOM names which has been configured.</p>
<p>User Can also search the UOM sets based on the Status Filter:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">        a.All Status b. Active C. Inactive
</code></pre>
<p>All Status- once the user selects the Filter as All Status All types of UOM set will get displayed on the screen.</p>
<p>Active- Once the user Selects the Filter as Active only Active UOM set List will get displayed on the screen.</p>
<p>In Active- Once the user selects the Filter as InActive at that Case only In-Active UOM set List will get displayed on the screen.</p>
<p>On the UOM set Column user can see the Set of UOMS which has been mapped In system.</p>
<p>The Status Column will be available In the Green color.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:100%;"><img src="/uom conversion/wiki.png"></figure>
<p>Once the user Clicks on 3 dots, the user can see the Edit Functionality which allows the user to edit the existing UOM set which has been mapped.</p>
<h5>Sample Reference Screen:</h5>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:100%;"><img src="/images/uom_conversion_image-2.png" alt="uom_conversion_image-2.png"></figure>
<p>As shown in the above screen once the user clicks on the edit user can edit the mapped Uom Set .</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:100%;"><img src="/images/uom_conversion-3.png" alt="uom_conversion-3.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly once the user Clicks on delete Functionality user can successfully delete the Mapped UOM set.</p>
<h5>Sample Reference screen:</h5>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:100%;"><img src="/images/uom_conversion-4.png" alt="uom_conversion-4.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>Once the user clicks on the delete button a Pop up screen appears which allows the user to delete Particular UOM set from the display screen on clicking on YES the UOM set will get deleted successfully from the screen.</p>
<h5>Sample Reference Screen:</h5>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:100%;"><img src="/images/uom_conversion-5.png" alt="uom_conversion-5.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once User clicks on down Arrow button of a Particular UOM set user will get able to see the Mapped conversions of that Particular UOM set.</p>
<p>For Example:</p>
<p>Let's take UOM set 13 once we click on down arrow button and the user will able to view the mapped conversions for that Particular UOM set.</p>
<h5>Sample Reference screen:</h5>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:100%;"><img src="/images/uom_conversion-6.1.png" alt="uom_conversion-6.1.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User can also click on modify button to edit the earlier conversions to get replace with new conversion values.</p>
<p>Once user makes the modifications In the UOm set once clicks on edit Finally need to click on save button so that Updated conversion will be able to get displayed on the screen.</p>
<p>BUOM- Base Unit of measurement.<br>BUOM Value- Base Unit of measurement Value.<br>Alternate UOM- Alternate UOM based on Based UOM.<br>Alternate UOM Value- Alternate UOM Value .</p>
<p>Example let's take Base UOM value as 1 and Base UOM as Roll and Alternate UOM Value as 100 and Alternate UOM as Meter.</p>
<p>The conversion will be: 1 Roll = 100 Meters.</p>
<h5>Sample Reference Screen:</h5>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:100%;"><img src="/images/uom-conversion-7.png" alt="uom-conversion-7.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To create a New UOM Set:</p>
<p>Once user clicks on Add Module the Screen will allow the User to add a New UOM Set:</p>
<p>User need to update the Basic details to add a New UOM Set:</p>
<p>UOM Set Name: User needs to enter the New UOM set name such as UOM SET 14.<br>Active- User need to make sure the Toggle Is in Active mode.</p>
<p>Add UOM Values:</p>
<p>Base UOM Value- User need to Provide the Base UOM value ( Example such as 1)<br>Base UOM- User need to Provide the Base UOM from the drop down ( Example Such as Roll)<br>Alternate UOM Value- User need to Provide the Alternate UOM Value ( Example such as 100)<br>Alternate UOM- User need to select the Alternate UOM from dropdown ( Example Such as Metres)</p>
<p>Than the Conversion Factor will be:<br>*1 Roll= 100 Meters *</p>
<h5>Sample Reference Screen:</h5>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:100%;"><img src="/images/uom_conversion-8.png" alt="uom_conversion-8.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Configuring the Mandatory Fields now user need to click on Add module and Finally need to click on save button<br>Once the user clicks on the save button the UOM set with mapped conversion fields will get added successfully on the display screen.<br>Now user can view the added UOM set on the Main display screen.</p>
<p>Note: Once a user clicks on the Discard Button the added details will disappear from the screen user need to add In Fresh manner once again.</p>
<h5>Sample Reference screen of Added UOM Set:</h5>
<p>In the List screen User will be able to see the added UOM Set once the UOM Set added successfully system will display an Pop up-message as “UOM added Successfully”</p>
<p>While Configuring the Base UOm and Alternate UOm User needs to select the required fields from the drop down</p>
<p>The UOMS such as Meters, Yards , Roll which was selected from drop down during the mapping the values these UOMS will get Reflected from the common Master.</p>
<p>Note: If the Required Base and Alternate UOM is not Reflecting In the drop down it means the UOMS need to get mapped In the Common Master.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:100%;"><img src="/images/uom-conversion-9.png" alt="uom-conversion-9.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Common Master Mapping :</strong></p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:100%;"><img src="/images/common_master.png" alt="common_master.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Shown In the Above sample Pic User needs to add the UOMS In the Common Master Inorder to Reflect the UOMS During the mapping of UOM Conversion.</p>
<p>Note: In search Tab user need to select the UOM master so that UOM master will get displayed on the display screen now user need to click on Add module to add the Required UOM.</p>
<h5>UOM Conversion Impact and Analysis</h5>
<p>Once the UOM Set is added In the UOM Conversion user need to go through the Product master and user can Create a Standard or Variant product with Mapping of Alternate UOMS.</p>
<h5>Sample Reference Screen:</h5>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:100%;"><img src="/images/common_master-2.png" alt="common_master-2.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Product Master Need to go through Product Dimensions where user need to click on the Use Alternate UOM check Box.<br>Once User clicks on the clicks on the Use Alternate UOM check box system will assign to map the Alternate UOM Set.</p>
<p>Example : In the UOM conversion we mapped a Particular UOM set such as 1 Roll= 100 meters as Shown In the above.</p>
<p>We will use the same conversion In Product Master- Product dimensions need to Put the UOM as Roll and Once we click on the Alternate UOM Check box system will configure the UOM set name from the Drop down ( Which was mapped earlier during UOM Conversion).</p>
<h5>Sample Screen Reference:</h5>
<p>User need to go through thePrice details and Need to Configure the Sales Price UOM and Sales Price AUOM from the Drop down.</p>
<p>The sales Price UOM will be configured as Roll which we mapped In Product dimensions and Sales Price AUOM will be configured as Meters.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:100%;"><img src="/images/last_image.png" alt="last_image.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the Mapping is completed successfully now user can sell the Product In the POS-Billing with Alternate UOM conversions.</p>
<p>Example: If User makes a Sell Of the T-shirt which has been mapped as 1 Roll= 100 meters<br>Now the user can make a bill with a digital Receipt for meters shirt.</p>
