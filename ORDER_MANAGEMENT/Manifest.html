<p>On the Manifest screen, the user will be able to see a list of all previously created manifests. The user can search through the existing manifests by using the search bar; Order Number, Shipping Number and Manifest Number can be used to carry out this search.</p>
<p>The user can also search based on the following criteria:</p>
<p>Channel Search: Filters manifests based on the channels from which the order was placed.</p>
<p>Shipping Carrier: Filters manifests based on the shipping carrier selected for an order.</p>
<p>Status: Filters manifests based on their status: MP Downloaded, Shipped, Ready, Draft.</p>
<p>Additionally, the user can select a particular manifest, and click on&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>button. It will download the manifest in a PDF format.</p>
<h2>How to create a New Manifest</h2>
<p>If the user wants to create a new manifest, they can click on the ‘+’ icon on the bottom right of the screen. After doing so, the below screen should appear.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:100%;"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3-byd8p3APANq9gcglqjeTSfV4pCV-zrMEoUeHwkuEbWMf_1RvxUYlZKvn3_WXdh8m84RPRCkcbWt1D2r6F686yAXfwJE5aVULwgsfJWJPcDsPyIStPBp1pFPhVycEYp2pOz2VzIfrhI8P38TOMPZQ"></figure>
<p>The user can then scan the order number or the tracking number of the delivery to add them to the manifest. Alternatively, the user can also search for orders, which will open up a window showing all orders in ‘RTS’ status (Ready to Ship). The user can select the orders they want included in the manifest by clicking the check boxes on the left side of the pop-up.</p>

<p>The Manifest No. is an automatically generated field for which the user does not need to input any information. This field cannot be edited once the manifest has gone past the ‘Draft’ status. Along with Manifest No., the Channel and Shipping Carrier section will also automatically populate once the Order and Tracking Numbers are selected.</p>
<p>Once all the above information has been entered, the user can then simply hit the ‘ADD’ button to add these orders into the manifest.</p>
<p>Before saving the manifest, the user can toggle its active status by clicking the&nbsp;</p>

<p>icon. If it is toggled grey, it means the manifest will be saved as a draft, however if it is toggled right, it means the manifest will be saved in ‘Ready’ status. If it is saved with the ‘Ready’ status, then the order status in the Order List screen will change to ‘Manifest Ready’.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The user cannot ship a manifest if any of the orders within that manifest are in ‘Manifest_InCancel’ status</p>
  <p>The user cannot put a manifest in ‘Ready’ status if any of the orders within that manifest are in ‘RTS_InCancel’ status</p>
