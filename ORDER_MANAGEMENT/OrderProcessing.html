<h1><u>Order Processing screen elements-&nbsp;</u></h1>
<p>The order processing screen consists of 3 sections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Order Tickers are tabs available in the list screen to display the orders in the logical groups based on their status. The List consists of 8 tickers - All, Allocation, Ready To Pick, Picked, Packed, Ready to Ship, Shipped, Exceptions, and Error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The READY TO SHIP ticker displays orders of ‘Ready to Ship’ &amp; ‘Shipment Ready’.</p>
<p>The ‘EXCEPTION’ ticker displays orders of status Hold by Rule, Hold by Routing, Rejected, and all In-cancel statuses (as Receive InCancel, RTS InCancel, etc.)</p>
<p>On clicking any ticker, the respective order list will populate.</p>
<p>Every ticker also has a count in it. This denotes the number of orders available in the ticker.</p>
<p>The ‘ERROR’ ticker consists of Error orders that need correction before processing. Further details of Error order processing are given in its section.</p>
<p>Order Actions&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This section consists of action buttons that are required to process the order in Ordazzle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users need to select the order that they need to process using the checkbox available on the left side of an order. After selecting an order, action buttons will appear underneath the order tickers, which the user can then accordingly select.</p>
<p>Each button performs a different action on the order. Users can select multiple orders and click the action button to perform actions in bulk. The actions available for bulk processing will depend on the statuses of the selected orders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can also select individual or partial order lines to process the order partially.</p>
