The Store Promotion sub-menu in the POS screen allows users to access and manage promotions specific to a particular store. Within the Promotion List screen, users can view a list of promotions available for that store.

From this screen, users have the option to edit or view each promotion. Editing a promotion enables users to make changes to its details, such as the promotion's duration, discount amount, or any specific terms and conditions. Viewing a promotion provides users with a detailed overview of the promotion, including its description, eligibility criteria, and any applicable restrictions.

By providing these functionalities in the Promotion List screen, the POS system simplifies the process of managing store promotions, allowing users to easily make adjustments or access information related to specific promotions without navigating to separate screens or menus.
