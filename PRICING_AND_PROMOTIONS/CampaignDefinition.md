# Campaign Defination
Campaign Master is a marketing campaign management system that allows users to create and track campaigns and promotions. A campaign can have multiple promotions associated with it, enabling users to manage and monitor various marketing activities within a specific campaign. However, a promotion can only be linked to a single campaign, ensuring that each promotion remains uniquely tied to its corresponding campaign. This design ensures efficient organization and clear tracking of marketing efforts, enabling effective management of multiple campaigns and their associated promotions.

In Campaign Master List Screen User can filter the list of campaigns based on their status. The available buttons are:

All: This button displays a list of campaigns regardless of their status, showing all campaigns in the system.

Active: Clicking on the Active button filters the list to show only the campaigns that are currently in an active status, meaning they are ongoing and not yet completed.

Completed: Selecting the Completed button filters the list to display campaigns that have reached their end date and are now considered completed.

Inactive: Clicking on the Inactive button filters the list to show campaigns that are currently in an inactive status, indicating that they are not currently running or active.

These filtering options provide users with the ability to focus on specific sets of campaigns based on their status, making it easier to review, manage, and analyze campaigns according to their different stages of completion and activity.

On the list page of Campaign Master, users can view the following information for each campaign:

Campaign Name: The name of the campaign, for example, "To increase Sale of casual shoes by 10%."

Campaign Status: Indicates whether the campaign is currently active or inactive. This helps users quickly identify the status of each campaign.

Target: Represents the target value or quantity set for the campaign. It could be a specific sales revenue goal or a desired number of items sold.

Actual: Reflects the actual value or quantity achieved during the campaign. This provides users with the real-world results and performance of the campaign.

Start DATE : Displays the Starting Date of Campaign.

End Date: Displays the end date of the campaign in UTC format, for example, "31-Dec-2019." This information helps users track the duration and timeline of each campaign.

Active Promotions: This column lists the promotions that are attached to the campaign and are currently in an active status. It provides visibility into the active marketing activities associated with the campaign.

Inactive Promotions: This column shows the promotions that are attached to the campaign but are currently in an inactive status. Users can see which promotions are no longer active, helping them assess the overall effectiveness of the campaign.

With this information, users can evaluate the performance of each campaign by comparing the target and actual values/quantities. They can also review the active and inactive promotions associated with the campaign, which can aid in decision-making regarding whether to keep the campaign active or consider deactivating it if all promotions have ended or become inactive.

In the Campaign Master system, users have the capability to track and analyze the target value/quantity and the actual achieved value/quantity for each specific campaign. 

This functionality allows users to set a target or goal for a particular metric, such as sales revenue or customer acquisition, and compare it with the actual results achieved during the campaign.

Users can input or define the target value/quantity at the beginning of the campaign, representing the desired outcome or objective they aim to accomplish. As the campaign progresses, the system enables users to record the actual value/quantity achieved, reflecting the real-world performance and effectiveness of the campaign.

By comparing the target and actual values/quantities, users can evaluate the success and effectiveness of their marketing efforts within a specific campaign. This information provides valuable insights for performance analysis, decision-making, and future campaign planning, helping users to optimize their marketing strategies and improve their overall results.

In The Campaign Master List Screen , There is 3 Dots Button Which has 3 Option View, Edit & Delete.

View: Clicking the "View" button allows users to view the campaign details. However, they cannot edit any of the fields. This action provides a read-only view of the campaign information.

Edit: Before the campaign status changes to "Active," users can edit all the fields in the Campaign Master system. This includes updating the common tags, my tags, marketing budget value, currency, status, end date, and whether new promotions can be added to the campaign. Once the campaign status changes to "Active," only certain fields can be edited. These editable fields are common tags, my tags, and the marketing budget value. The purpose of these limitations is to maintain the integrity of the campaign data once it becomes active.

Delete: Users can delete a campaign only if it has not been activated and there are no promotions attached to it. This restriction ensures that campaigns with associated promotions are not inadvertently deleted, preserving data integrity.
