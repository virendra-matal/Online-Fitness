<h1><strong>Markdown Price List</strong></h1>
<p>A price list is used to automatically calculate prices on scanned products in transactions. This master allows defining markdown/markup on existing price lists for products. This price list will be applicable on billing, purchase orders, and transfer orders.</p>
<p><strong>Markdown</strong>: It is a reduction of the product price, based on the inability to sell it at the initial price or original selling price. In other words, markdown is the <strong>difference between the original retail price and the actual selling price</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>For example</strong>, a shirt in a clothing shop can initially cost $50. If almost no one wants to buy it at this price, it is common that a markdown (for example of 20%) is introduced. Now the new price of the product will be $40.</p>
<p><strong>Markup</strong>: It is a raise of the product price, based on the maximum demand to sell it at a new profitable price. In other words, markup is the <strong>premium over the total cost of the good or service that provides the seller with a profit</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>For example</strong>, a shirt in a clothing shop can initially cost $50. If demand is high for this product then the seller can raise the price and markup (for example 20%) is introduced. Now the new price of the product will be $60.</p>

<p><strong>Markdown Slab Price: </strong>This field indicates which markdown slab will be used for markdown/markup calculation while transaction processing.

<p>For example: If a product ABC is having a sales price of 60$ and now the user wants to create a markdown price with 15% and if the newly calculated markdown price of the product falls in the range of the selected markdown slab price then the slab price will be the new price for the product then the new markdown price is 51$ post calculation, but it falls in the defined range of markdown slab price, therefore, the new markdown price will be 55$.</p>
<p>I.e. markdown 15% of original price 60$ =&nbsp; 51&nbsp;</p>
<p>Range 50 to 60 , Slab price = 55</p>
<p>The new markdown price will be 55</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rounding Off Rule : </strong>This field indicates which rounding-off rule will be applicable for the markdown/markup price calculation. (This will be disabled if ‘Markdown Slab Price’ is selected)</li>
