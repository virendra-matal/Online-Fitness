<h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Use Cases and Capabilities of Product Catalog in ETP Unify:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Product Catalog is a function which helps the user set up and organize various types of products with different attribute sets into catalogs.</li>
  <li>A Product Catalog is a screen where all the options and columns needed to create a product through Product Master is available.</li>
  <li>The User can select the columns in the Product Catalog based on the product they want to create in the Product Master.</li>
  <li>The Product Catalog also has options to View, make a column Mandatory and provide edit access for the column.</li>
  <li>Say, if the Product is soap then, we can configure the columns needed to create a soap through the catalog. This is a module to personalize the product creation screen based on the product being created.</li>
  <li>The Products Tshirts, pants and trousers which come under clothing do not have an expiration date, so that the user can configure the product catalog without those details like expiry date etc, during the creation of the Product catalogs of Tshirts and Pants etc. This will save a lot of time when a user is creating a specific product so that the User does not have to view the columns appropriate for the product being created.</li>
  <li>The User can configure upto 3 variant dimensions in case the Product also come in variants. The usual dimensions are colors, sizes and material for clothing products.</li>
  <li>The User can add the variant attributes in the catalog so that, when a parent Product is created, the variant attributes will fetch attribute values from common master under each attribute based on the values added by the User in Common master.</li>
  <li>The Product Catalog module has provisions to add additional attributes for the specific catalog created, In case an attribute which is needed for the catalog is not available in the module, the User can add the Column needed , weather its a drop down or a free field or a check box. The user can also label the new additional attribute available, so that the same will appear in the Product create screen. The user can also make it Mandatory or non mandatory based on the business requirement.</li>
  <li>A provision to add an image to the catalogs created is also available. Now we can look into details on how to configure the Product Catalog the specifications as well.</li>
</ul>
