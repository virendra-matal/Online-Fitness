<h1>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PRODUCT MASTER-WIKI-ETP UNIFY</h1>
<h3><strong>Product Master Use Cases and Capabilities:</strong></h3>
<p>A Product Master in a retail software system is a centralized repository of information about the products a retailer sells. It serves as a critical component for managing and optimizing various retail operations.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Inventory Management</strong>: The Product Master helps retailers keep track of their inventory. It stores information about product names, SKUs, descriptions, prices, and quantities. Retailers can use this data to ensure they have the right amount of stock on hand, reducing both overstocking and understocking issues.</li>
  <li><strong>Pricing Strategy</strong>: Retailers can use the Product Master to set and adjust pricing strategies. By storing information about product costs, margins, and competitor pricing, retailers can make data-driven decisions to optimize their pricing.</li>
  <li><strong>Merchandising</strong>: Retailers can use the Product Master to plan and execute their merchandising strategies. This includes organizing products by categories, brands, and attributes, as well as managing product hierarchies and relationships.</li>
  <li><strong>Order Fulfillment</strong>: When customers place orders, the Product Master can help determine product availability, lead times, and shipping options. This ensures that customers receive accurate information about delivery times and product availability.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-channel Retailing</strong>: In a multi-channel retail environment (e.g., brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce, mobile apps), the Product Master ensures consistency in product information across all channels. Customers should see the same product details and prices regardless of where they interact with the retailer.</li>
  <li><strong>Vendor Management</strong>: Retailers can use the Product Master to manage relationships with suppliers and vendors. It can store information about vendor contacts, contracts, and performance metrics.</li>
  <li><strong>Loss Prevention</strong>: Retailers can use the Product Master to track and monitor high-value or high-risk items, aiding in loss prevention efforts. This includes tracking serial numbers, security features, and alerting systems for suspicious activities.</li>
</ul>
