<p><strong>Customer Circle</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This functionality is to allow the admin level user at HO to create Customer Circle criteria for different sets of stores. Customers are created at every store of the company. This generally leads to the creation of multiple customer records for the same individual. To avoid this duplicate records creation, a Customer Circle is required. At the time of registering a new customer with its details it searches for the existing customer database &amp; their Email ID and/or phone number based on the defined Customer Circle criteria for the store.</p>
<p>Customer Circle helps you to define deduplication criteria for customer creation. Defining Customer Circle also helps you to avoid duplicate customer creation.(Unify &gt; CRM &gt; Customer Circle)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While creating the Customer Circle criteria, the user will select the criteria defining properties, also will select the set of stores based on provided store attribute fields.</p>
