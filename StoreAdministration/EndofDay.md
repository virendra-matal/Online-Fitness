# END OF THE DAY
In retail, "End of Day" (EOD) refers to the conclusion of the business day or the operational day for a retail store or establishment. It marks the point in time when the store closes for the day and ceases its daily operations. The End of Day process is significant in retail management as it involves several crucial tasks and procedures to wrap up the day's activities and prepare for the next day.

Store Closing: The physical store or retail location is closed to the public at the designated closing time. This involves locking doors, turning off lights, and ensuring that all areas of the store are secure.

Cash Handling: Cash registers and point-of-sale (POS) systems are typically used to complete transactions throughout the day. At the End of Day, registers are closed, and cashiers count the cash in their tills to reconcile with sales records. This process helps identify any discrepancies and ensures that the register balance matches the expected cash amount.

Transaction Reconciliation: All sales and transactions made during the day are reconciled and recorded. This includes credit card transactions, cash sales, returns, exchanges, and other financial activities.

Inventory Management: Inventory records are updated to reflect the day's sales and any adjustments made, such as restocking or removing damaged items. This helps maintain accurate inventory levels.

Cash Deposits: Cashiers or store managers may prepare cash deposits for banking, ensuring that cash is securely stored and transported to the bank.

Closing Reports: Detailed closing reports are often generated from the POS system, summarizing sales, returns, and other transaction data for the day. These reports provide insights into daily performance.
