<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Expense</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The bank expense list screen enables users to create and manage expenses associated with different cost centers. Users can create an expense record for the store based on the expense type, which is associated with the respective cost centers or the user. Additionally, users can create an expense record, even if it is paid from the head office.</p>
